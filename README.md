TVS REST Support for Custom Post Types
======================================

This plugin adds support for several custom post types used by our WordPress install "The Hub". It also
resolves the issue where private posts of these custom post types cannot be queried through the REST API,
even when the user account in question has the appropriate permissions. This is achieved through a custom
REST controller for these post types.
